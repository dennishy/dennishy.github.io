Data was sourced from the Formula 1 API provided by [Ergast](https://ergast.com/mrd/) and processed into [Tidy Data](https://dennishy.github.io/data/2020/05/02/Tidy-Data.html) using pandas in Python. For the full Jupyter Notebook with complete examples please refer [here](https://github.com/dennishy/jupyter_notebooks/blob/master/Seaborn%20Swarmplot%20-%20F1%20Pit%20Times.ipynb).
