Hello and welcome! 

I'm Dennis and this is my blog. 

I've spent the last 8+ years consulting organizations on all sorts of data oriented initiatives and wanted to catalog the notes I've found helpful and share some visualizations I thought were neat to do. I'll be covering different aspects of data engineering, warehousing, analysis, and visualization so stick around.

Please send me an email at [dennis.y.hong@gmail.com](dennis.y.hong@gmail.com) or contact me at my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dennisyhong/) if there's a dataset you'd like me to play with or if there are any topics you'd like covered. 

Thanks for stopping by.

P.S. Here is my dog Wyatt - he has nothing to do with this blog but I think he's the best
